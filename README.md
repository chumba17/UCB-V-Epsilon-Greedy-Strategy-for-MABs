# Reinforcement Learning Strategies: UCB vs Epsilon-Greedy

This repository contains a Python implementation of a simple reinforcement learning environment to compare the performance of two popular action selection strategies: UCB (Upper Confidence Bound) and Epsilon-Greedy. The goal is to investigate how these strategies impact the learning efficiency and overall performance of an agent.

Reinforcement learning often involves choosing actions to maximize cumulative rewards over time. Two common strategies for action selection are UCB and Epsilon-Greedy. This project aims to compare and analyze the performance of these strategies in a simulated environment.
